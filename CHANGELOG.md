[Full Changelog](https://github.com/realityforge/router-fu/compare/v0.12...v0.13)

* ðŸ’¥ **\[core\]** Upgrade Arez to version `0.97`.
* **\[processor\]** Stop annotating the generated `build*Location(...)` methods with

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/realityforge/router-fu/compare/v0.11...v0.12)

* ðŸ’¥ **\[core\]** Upgrade Arez to version `0.96`.

  able to perform dead code elimination, including removing the class literals for the
  lambdas.
